# Unity3D
Use of these scripts is free (read: http://unlicense.org/). Crediting the author (me! :D) is not required at all, athough it is
not discouraged or unwelcomed - although I encourage anyone using these assets to contribute to the public domain aswell by
releasing as many scripts and projects as you feel comfortable with under the Unlicense/ similar licenses where you can legally and ethically do so.

  These scripts may sometimes serve purposes already covered by standard Unity assets, but mine are generally easier to understand
and shorter/ lighter weight, allowing for more customizability. They will, furthermore, generally be made to fit standard/ default
PC control schemes where applicable and may not work on other platforms.

  Have fun!
