# Unity3D
Use of these scripts is free (read: http://unlicense.org/). Crediting the author (me! :D) is not required at all, athough it is
not discouraged or unwelcomed - although I encourage anyone using these assets to contribute to the public domain aswell by
releasing as many scripts and projects as you feel comfortable with under the Unlicense/ similar licenses where you can legally 
and ethically do so.

  These scripts may sometimes serve purposes already covered by standard Unity assets, but mine are generally easier to understand
and shorter/ lighter weight, allowing for more customizability. They will, furthermore, generally be made to fit standard/ default
PC control schemes where applicable and may not work on other platforms.

  Whenever you use a script from this repository, make sure to read the documentation comment attatched to the top of the script,
as well as the usage comments beside public variables to make sure you are using the script correctly. Also attatched are 
explanatory comments that explain code segments, but these should not be necessary to use unless you are editing the script directly.

  Have fun!
